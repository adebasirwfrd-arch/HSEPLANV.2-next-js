The UI is looking great. Now let's build the Enterprise "Audit Trail" feature.
The `audit_logs` table is already populated automatically by Supabase Triggers. I need a page to view these logs.

1.  **Create Hook**: `hooks/useAuditLogs.ts`
    - Fetch data from `audit_logs` table.
    - Sort by `created_at` descending (newest first).
    - Limit to last 100 logs by default.

2.  **Create Page**: `app/audit-logs/page.tsx`
    - Use the existing `AppShell`.
    - Display a clean table with columns: Date/Time, Actor (User Email), Action (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), Target (Program Name), and Details.
    - **Visuals**:
      - Use badges for Actions (Green for INSERT, Blue for UPDATE, Red for DELETE).
      - Make it look professional (Glassmorphism style like other pages).
    - **Filtering**: Add a simple search bar to filter logs by description or email.

3.  **Update Navigation**:
    - Add the "Audit Logs" link to the Sidebar or Settings page so I can access it.

Please provide the code for the Hook and the Page.
