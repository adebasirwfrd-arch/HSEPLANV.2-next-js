I encountered a "Turbopack build failed" error related to `@react-pdf/renderer` in `app/otp/page.tsx`.
This is a known issue where React-PDF cannot be rendered on the server during build time.

Please refactor the code to fix this by isolating the PDF logic:

1.  **Create a Client Component**: `components/otp/PDFDownloadButton.tsx`
    - Move the imports: `PDFDownloadLink` and `HSEMonthlyReport` into this file.
    - Props: Accept `data` (programs), `region`, `base`, `year`.
    - Render: The `PDFDownloadLink` wrapping the "Download Report" button.
    - IMPORTANT: If the document is loading, show a "Generating..." text.

2.  **Update `app/otp/page.tsx`**:
    - Remove imports of `@react-pdf/renderer` and `HSEMonthlyReport` from this file.
    - Import the new button dynamically with SSR disabled:
      ```tsx
      import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
      const PDFDownloadButton = dynamic(
        () => import('@/components/otp/PDFDownloadButton'),
        { ssr: false }
      )
      ```
    - Replace the old button code with `<PDFDownloadButton ... />`.

This will ensure the PDF library is only loaded on the client-side, fixing the build error.
