Now for the final Enterprise feature: PDF Reporting.
I need to generate a monthly HSE Report PDF directly from the browser.

1.  **Install**: Please give me the command to install `@react-pdf/renderer`.

2.  **Create Report Component**: `components/reports/HSEMonthlyReport.tsx`
    - This is a PDF document component (using `<Document>`, `<Page>`, `<View>` from react-pdf).
    - **Layout**: A4 Portrait.
    - **Header**: Company Logo (left), "HSE MONTHLY REPORT" (right), Period (Month/Year).
    - **Content**:
      - "Executive Summary": A small table showing Total Programs, % Completion, and Total Overdue.
      - "Critical Items": A list of Overdue programs (Red text).
      - "Progress Details": A table listing all programs and their current progress bar.
    - **Footer**: "Generated by HSE System on [Date]" and a placeholder for "Approved By" signature.

3.  **Integrate**:
    - Add a "📄 Download Report" button in `app/otp/page.tsx` (next to the Export CSV button).
    - When clicked, it should generate and download this PDF using the current data.

Please provide the installation command, the PDF component code, and the updated OTP page snippet.
