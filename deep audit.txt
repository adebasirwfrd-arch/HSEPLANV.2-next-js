I need a COMPLETE SYSTEM AUDIT AND DEBUG. Environment variables are set, but I'm still getting Error 500. 

### 1. CREDENTIAL VALIDATION
- Create a temporary diagnostic block in `app/api/stream/token/route.ts` to log (to the server console only) if the variables exist:
  `console.log('DEBUG: KEY EXISTS:', !!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_API_KEY)`
  `console.log('DEBUG: SECRET EXISTS:', !!process.env.STREAM_API_SECRET)`
  `console.log('DEBUG: APP ID EXISTS:', !!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_APP_ID)`

### 2. CORE INITIALIZATION TEST
- Test if `stream.connect(key, secret, appId)` actually succeeds. 
- If it fails, capture the EXACT error message from Stream (e.g., "Invalid Key", "Region Mismatch", or "Plan Limit Reached") and return it in the 500 response body.

### 3. FEED GROUP SANITY CHECK
- Attempt to fetch the 'user' feed group for user 'ade4' server-side.
- Log if the feed group 'user' or 'timeline' is not found in the Stream Dashboard configuration.

### 4. CLIENT-SIDE CATCH
- Update `lib/stream-service.ts` to log the FULL response from the 500 error.
- Use `const errorData = await response.json()` to show me exactly what the server is complaining about in the browser console.

### 5. CLEAN RESTORE
- Remove any redundant logic that tries to delete selectors. Focus only on getting a valid token first.
