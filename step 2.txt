I have finalized the Stream Dashboard. Let's build Tahap 2:

### 1. STREAM IDENTITY SYNC
* In `app/api/stream/token/route.ts`, fetch the user's name and avatar from the Supabase session.
* Use `client.user(userId).update({ name: userName, image: userAvatar })` to ensure every post shows the real Google profile data.

### 2. HOME FEED UI
* Place the `PostComposer` component on the Home Page below the AIConsultant section.
* Implement the main feed using the 'timeline' group. 
* Enable real-time updates so new posts appear instantly via `.subscribe()`.

### 3. NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
* Add the Bell Icon in `AppShell` (header).
* Connect it to the 'notification' feed group to show the unread badge count.
* When clicked, mark notifications as seen using `feed.get({ mark_seen: true })`.

### 4. MEDIA UPLOADS
* Ensure `PostComposer` can upload images/videos directly to Stream's CDN for high-performance HSE reporting.
