We are implementing **Phase 4 (Package A): CI/CD Automation**.

Please create a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically test and build the application on every push.

**1. Create Directory:**
   Ensure the folder `.github/workflows/` exists.

**2. Create File: `.github/workflows/production.yml`**
   Add the following YAML configuration:

   ```yaml
   name: Production Build Check

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ "main" ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ "main" ]

   jobs:
     build:
       name: Build and Test
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout Code
           uses: actions/checkout@v4

         - name: Setup Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with:
             node-version: '20'
             cache: 'npm'

         - name: Install Dependencies
           run: npm ci

         - name: Run Linter
           run: npm run lint
           # This ensures no messy code or type errors get merged

         - name: Run Build
           run: npm run build
           # This catches the "Turbopack" or "React PDF" errors early
           env:
             # We need to mock these for build to pass if they are used in static generation
             NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL }}
             NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
             # Add a dummy key for build purposes if needed, or configure Secrets in GitHub later
