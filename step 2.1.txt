I want a fully automated "Self-Healing" system for Stream.io. DO NOT add any buttons; this must happen automatically in the background.

### 1. AUTOMATED FEED SYNC
- In `app/api/stream/token/route.ts`, every time a token is generated:
    - Automatically call `client.feed('timeline', userId).follow('user', userId)`.
    - This ensures that posts from the 'user' feed group always flow to the 'timeline' without manual follow actions.

### 2. API-BASED CONFIGURATION FIX
- Implement a logic that checks the 'notification' feed group via the Stream Server SDK.
- If it finds any 'following' selectors (which are causing errors in the dashboard), the code must programmatically remove them.
- Ensure the 'notification' group is kept clean for real-time bell notifications.

### 3. IDENTITY AUTO-UPDATE
- Every login session must trigger a profile sync:
    - Update the Stream User profile with the latest Google Name and Avatar URL from the Supabase session.

### 4. ERROR RESILIENCE
- If the Stream connection fails, the app must gracefully retry in the background without showing error pop-ups to the user.
