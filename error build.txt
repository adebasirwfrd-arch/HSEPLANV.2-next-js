@File (app/auth/callback/route.ts)

I am getting the error {"error":"requested path is invalid"} because the redirect URL is being concatenated incorrectly. 

Please fix the authentication flow:
1. In `app/login/page.tsx`, ensure the `redirectTo` string is constructed precisely:
   `const redirectTo = `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback``
   Make sure there are no extra slashes or hardcoded paths that could cause the URL merging error seen in my logs.

2. In `app/auth/callback/route.ts`, verify that the `origin` is correctly extracted from the request URL to redirect the user back to the Vercel dashboard after the exchange.

3. Ensure that `next: '/dashboard'` or similar parameters are not causing the 'invalid path' error by being appended incorrectly to the Supabase URL.
