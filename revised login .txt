I am ready to connect the UI to the existing Supabase backend. We need a **Full-Screen Login** and **Admin Mode** using Environment Variables for flexibility.

### 1. CONFIGURATION (Admin Access)
* Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL` from environment variables to define the admin.
* In `hooks/useAdmin.ts`, implement: 
  `const isAdmin = user?.email === process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL;`
* This allows me to change the admin email easily without touching the code.

### 2. FULL-SCREEN PREMIUM LOGIN (app/login/page.tsx)
* Create a **Full-Screen Split Layout** (No Sidebar/AppShell).
* **Left Side (Branding):** Use a dark ocean gradient. 
  * Add a Lottie animation (Safety Mascot).
  * Use **GSAP** to animate the headline text with a staggered fade-in effect.
* **Right Side (Auth):** * Clean Shadcn/UI Form.
  * Add "Sign in with Microsoft" and "Sign in with Google" buttons using Supabase OAuth.
  * Add a "Keep me logged in" checkbox (Supabase handles session persistence by default).
* **Entrance Animation:** Use **GSAP** so the login card "pops" in from the center with a slight bounce.

### 3. PROTECTED UI (The "Admin Lock")
Apply `isAdmin` check to these components:
* **Audit Logs:** If `!isAdmin`, redirect to `/` or show "Access Denied" glass-card.
* **KPI & OTP Pages:** * Wrap all "Add", "Edit", "Delete", and "Upload" buttons in `{isAdmin && (...)}`.
  * Ensure table cells are not clickable (read-only) for non-admins.
* **Navigation:** Add a small "View-Only" badge in the header if the user is not an admin.

### 4. SUPABASE DATA SYNC
* Since the tables already exist in Supabase, update `lib/programs-store.ts` to fetch and push data directly to Supabase `program_progress` table.
* Ensure "Stay Logged In" works by setting `persistSession: true` in the Supabase client.

### 5. MIDDLEWARE
* Update `middleware.ts` to protect all routes except `/login`. 
* If a user is logged in, they should be redirected away from `/login` to the dashboard.
