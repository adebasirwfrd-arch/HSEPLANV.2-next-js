Now that the Login system is active, I want to upgrade the Audit Logs to be fully automated and premium.

### 1. Automated Tracking
* Update all database mutation functions in `lib/programs-store.ts` (Create, Update, Delete) to ensure they trigger an entry in the `audit_logs` table.
* The `user_email` should be automatically captured from the active Supabase session.

### 2. UI Enhancements (Premium Security)
* In `AuditLogsPage`, update the `filteredLogs` logic to allow filtering by 'Actor' (User Email).
* Add a "JSON Viewer" modal: When a user clicks an 'UPDATE' row, show the raw data changes (Old vs New) for deep forensics.
* Improve the `ActionBadge` icons: Use `ShieldAlert` for DELETE and `ShieldCheck` for INSERT.

### 3. Safety Check
* Ensure ONLY the user with email `ade.basirwfrd@gmail.com` can access this page.
* Non-admins should be redirected to the dashboard with a "Unauthorized" toast.
